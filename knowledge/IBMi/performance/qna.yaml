- context: provide a basic understanding of IBM i on Power performance |
    concepts, workloads and benchmarks on Power, capacity planning, performance monitoring and |
    analysis, frequently asked questions and guidelines addressing common performance issues. 
  question: What Is Performance?
  answer: Computer performance is largely determined by a combination of response time and throughput. Other |
    aspects associated with computer performance are availability of computer systems and their power |
    efficiency.

  question: What is response time?
  answer: The response time of a computer system is the elapsed time between the end of a transaction inquiry or|
    demand and the beginning of a response to that transaction. For interactive users, the response time is|
    the time from when the user hits the <enter> button to seeing the result displayed. The response time|
    often is seen as a critical aspect of performance because of its potential visibility to end users or|
    customers.|
    Let’s take the example of a computer system that is running a web server with an online store. The |
    response time here is the elapsed time between pressing the submit button to place an order and the |
    beginning of receiving the order confirmation.

  question: What Is throughput?
  answer: The throughput of a computer system is a measure of the amount of work performed by a computer |
    system over the period of time. Examples for throughput are megabytes per second read from a disk, |
    database transactions per minute, megabytes transmitted per second through a network adapter. |
    Let’s go back to the previous example with the online store. The computer system on which the online |
    store is running might be one out of many computers that are all connected to the same database |
    server. While response time of the database server is an important factor, its throughput may be more |
    important because it processes many requests from the web servers in parallel.

  question: What Is wait accounting?
  answer: Wait Accounting is the patented technology built into the IBM® i operating system that tells you what a  |
    thread or task is doing when it appears that it is not doing anything. When a thread or task is not |
    executing, it is waiting. Wait accounting, a concept exclusive to IBM i, is a very powerful capability for |
    detailed performance analysis. The following information is going to focus on waiting, why threads wait, |
    and how you can use wait accounting to troubleshoot performance problems or to simply improve the |
    performance of your applications.

  question: What are the general performance tuning recommendations for best IBM i performance?
  answer: There is no such thing as a general performance tuning recommendation.
